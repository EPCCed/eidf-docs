## EIDF Regular Maintenance Sessions

Maintenance sessions are used to ensure that:

- Essential security patches are applied
- Software versions are kept up to date
- Firmware levels on peripheral equipment are kept up to date
- Failed/suspect hardware can be replaced
- New software can be installed
- Essential maintenance on electrical and mechanical support equipment (cooling systems and power distribution units) can be undertaken safely

We aim to minimize maintenance downtime on the service, but occasionally need to perform essential work on the system.

There is currently no common maintenance window that covers all services. Each service is maintained according to its needs. We will email users one week ahead of maintenance outages to notify them that the service will be unavailable.
