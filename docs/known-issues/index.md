##Â `md5sum` gives poor performance on SDF-CS1

We have identified that the `md5sum` utility can give extremely poor performance 
on the SDF-CS1 system (also known as Ultra2, Superdome Flex). We recommend that
users avoid using this tool on the system at the moment.

We are investigating the issue with the hardware vendor and will update this issue
with any information for users as it becomes available.
