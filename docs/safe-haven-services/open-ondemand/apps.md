## Introduction

The following apps are available on Open OnDemand.

| App | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ----------- |
| [Active Jobs](./apps/active-jobs.md) | System Installed App | Open OnDemand app that allows you to browse and manage jobs created via both apps and the 'Job Composer' app |
| [Job Composer](./apps/job-composer.md) | System Installed App | Open OnDemand app that allows you to submit a Slurm batch job to a back-end |
| [Run JupyterLab](./apps/jupyter-app.md) | Tenant Service | Container Execution Service app that allows you to run a JupyterLab container on a back-end |
| [Run RStudio Server](./apps/rstudio-app.md) | Tenant Service | Container Execution Service app that allows you to run an RStudio Server container on a back-end |
| [Run Container](./apps/container-app.md) | Tenant and HPC Service | Container Execution Service app that allows you to run a container on a back-end |

The app types are:

* 'System Installed App': apps provided with Open OnDemand.
* 'Tenant Service': apps to run jobs on back-ends within your safe haven.
* 'Tenant and HPC Service': apps to run jobs on back-ends within both your safe haven and on TRE-level resources.

Open OnDemand supports a number of ways by which you can see the apps available to you and select an app to run.

In each case, selecting an app will open an app-specific page, from which you can run the app, for which Open OnDemand will create and run a job.

!!! Note

    If you are wondering why the 'Apps' menu and 'Jobs' menu overlap, this is because each app has a 'category' label. This is used by Open OnDemand both to group app buttons on the front page and to create menus with apps belonging to a specific category. All our apps are within a 'Jobs' category, hence the overlap.
