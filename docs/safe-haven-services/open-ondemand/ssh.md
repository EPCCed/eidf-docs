# Log into back-ends

---

## Introduction

Open OnDemand allows you to log into a back-end or the Open OnDemand host (if applicable) in a number of ways.

In each case, a new browser tab will open for the selected host.

When prompted, enter your project username and password.

!!! Note

    If you see 'Open OnDemand host Shell Access' listed as an option anywhere, then you can log into the Open OnDemand host. This is supported for users who have access to back-ends where user home directories are not common to both the Open OnDemand host and those back-ends.
