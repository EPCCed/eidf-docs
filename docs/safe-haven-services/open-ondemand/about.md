# About the TRE Open OnDemand service

Open OnDemand is a web portal that runs within a safe haven. Open OnDemand allows users to log into compute resources available within a safe haven, and to submit tasks to these compute resources.

Open OnDemand provides a number of apps that allow for researchers' containers to be executed via the TRE Container Execution Service as well as providing apps supporting the execution of standard containers with useful services such as JupyterLab and RStudio Server.

To quickly get started with Open OnDemand:

* [Access Open OnDemand](./access.md).
* Read about how to Open OnDemand runs tasks, which it terms 'jobs', on compute resources available within your safe haven in [Run jobs](./jobs.md).
* Then, read about how to Open OnDemand runs containers via jobs in [Run containers](./containers.md).
* [Run a 'hello-tre' example container](./apps/container-app.md#run-a-hello-tre-example-container) using the '[Run Container](./apps/container-app.md)' app.
