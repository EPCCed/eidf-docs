# About the TRE Open OnDemand service

The TRE Open OnDemand service is a web service that runs within a safe haven. The service allows you to run compute and data-related tasks on compute resources available to your safe haven.

The service provides a number of apps that allow for researchers' containers - which package up software, services and their dependencies - to be executed via the TRE Container Execution Service as well as providing apps supporting the execution of standard containers with useful services such as JupyterLab and RStudio Server.
