## Restart your Open OnDemand session

Select the **Help (?)** menu, **Restart Web Server** option to restart your Open OnDemand session.

!!! Note

    Despite its name, this option does not restart the Open OnDemand web server! It restarts your session only. It does not affect other users!

!!! Tip

    If the Open OnDemand service or apps have been updated during your session, then **Restart Web Server** allows you to pick up such changes without having to log out and log back into Open OnDemand,
