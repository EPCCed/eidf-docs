!!! Info

    Despite its name, this option does not restart the web server upon which Open OnDemand runs! It restarts your session only. It does not affect other users!

!!! Tip

    If Open OnDemand has been updated during your session, then **Restart Web Server** allows you to pick up such changes without having to log out and log back in again.
