# TRE Code Management and Mirroring Service

!!! warning "Beta Service"
    This service is in early development, and the content of this page may change significantly. Please provide all feedback to your IG team.

The Code Management and Mirroring Service provides Researchers and IG teams with access to a platform similar to GitHub for managing code inside the TRE. Automatic inbound mirroring of external code repositories is also available if permitted by the IG team.

A separate instance of the service is available to each TRE tenancy, and each instance is accessible only within the tenancy it is deployed to.

!!! note "Availabilty"
    This service is an add-on to the base tenancy offering, and so may not be available to all TRE users. Please enquire with your IG team to determine if it is available to you.

## Overview

The service is based on the [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) collaborative version control system, which offers many of the same features as GitHub and GitLab. Some restrictions, such as the ability to freely create repositories, are in place in order to ensure separation of project data as per IG requirements.

Available features include:

- Software version control
- Pull and push while inside the TRE
- Bug and issue tracking
- Pull Requests
- Code review
- Wikis
