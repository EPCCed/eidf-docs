# Container Examples

To help with writing your own Dockerfiles to run within a Trusted Research Environment via the Container Execution Service, we have provided a set of examples for commonly used software stacks, which can be found in our [TRE Container Samples repository](https://github.com/EPCCed/tre-container-samples/tree/main).

Please contact your Service Manager if you need further support with the use of containers available in the [EPCC TRE Container Samples epository](https://github.com/EPCCed/tre-container-samples/tree/main).

Most of these containers are minimum working examples, they are not fully fledged applications or workflow examples, but provide a template for setting up the technical parts of the containerisation process, such as user mapping, and mapping to any required `safe_data` folders or similar. Please refer to the `README` in each example for guidance on how to use the container.
