| [Job Composer](apps/job-composer.md) | System Installed App | Write and submit a Slurm batch job to a back-end |

The app types are:

* 'System Installed App': General purpose apps provided with Open OnDemand.
* 'Tenant Service': Apps to run jobs on back-ends within your safe haven.
* 'Tenant and SHS': Apps to run jobs on back-ends within both your safe haven and on SHS-level compute resources.

Open OnDemand supports a number of ways by which you can see the apps available to you and select an app to run.

In each case, selecting an app will open an app-specific page, from which you can run the app, for which Open OnDemand will create and run a job.
