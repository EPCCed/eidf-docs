# Container Examples

To help with writing your own Dockerfiles to run within the SHS via the CES, a set of examples for commonly used software stacks can be found in our [SHS Container Samples](https://github.com/EPCCed/tre-container-samples/) repository.

Please contact your Service Manager if you need further support with the use of containers.

These containers are not fully fledged applications or workflow examples, but provide a template for setting up the technical parts of the containerisation process such as user mapping, and mapping to any required `safe_data` directories or similar. Please refer to the `README` in each example for guidance on how to use the container.
