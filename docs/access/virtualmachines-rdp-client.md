# Accessing Virtual Machines via an RDP Client

Easy connection to a remote desktop is possible via the [Guacamole](https://guacamole.eidf.ac.uk/) web interface. A remote desktop client application can be useful for longer work. Dedicated remote desktop viewer programs allow better support of copy and paste, file sharing and other features that may not be available in the web interface.

We refer to a Host machine as the machine with a RDP server running on it, within EIDF infrastructure this is the Virtual Desktop.

The Client machine is any machine that you are using to connect to the host machine via the RDP protocol and remote desktop viewing software.

It would be recommended to have accessed the host machine via Guacamole first as this process is simpler see instructions in [Virtual Machines (VMs) and the EIDF Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI)](virualmachines-vdi.md)

## Ensure RDP is running on the host machine

You can check if the xrdp service is running on the host machine by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
host-machine$ systemctl status xrdp
```

Expecting the status to contain `Active: active (running)` e.g.

```bash
host-machine$ systemctl status xrdp 
‚óè xrdp.service - xrdp daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/xrdp.service; enabled; vendor preset: )
     Active: active (running) since ...
       Docs: man:xrdp(8)
             man:xrdp.ini(5)
   Main PID: 701 (xrdp)
   [...]
```

## Setup Port Forwarding from the host machine to the client machine

!!! note
     Port forwarding is needed to get through the EIDF gateway. Whilst some remote desktop viewers support gateways they do not always work (e.g. the Windows app for macOS does not support SSH keys)

Set up a port forwarding such that the RDP port on the remote desktop (`3389`) is forwarded to the `localhost` of the client machine you are running the remote desktop viewer on, in this example we use `23001`.

!!! warning "Port on the client machine must be unused"
    Ports are usable by one process only as such must use one that is not in use. **Typically** port `23001` is unused. Checking if a port is in use is client device OS-specific

In a terminal or cmd prompt on the client machine run the following command:

```shell
client-machine$ ssh -N -J <gateway username>@eidf-gateway.epcc.ed.ac.uk -L 23001:<VDI machine IP>:3389 <VDI username>@<VDI machine IP>
```

You should see the remote desktop gateway message and the terminal will then be attached to the SSH process without allowing input
e.g.

```text
client-machine$ ssh -N -J bc-eidfstaff@eidf-gateway.epcc.ed.ac.uk -L 23001:10.24.5.5:3389 bc-eidf124@10.24.5.5

## Install and configure a remote desktop viewer

Different distributions have different software solutions for remote desktop connections.

Instructions specific to the operating system in use are given in the below sections. If you have your own preferred remote desktop viewing software or cannot use the below instructions for whatever reason then the key details to be configured are:

```text
PC or server name and port: localhost:23001
VDI account credentials: We recommend leaving this blank or as 'Ask when 
required' until you have successfully connected to the machine. If prompted for 
credentials you will need those which you have for VDI connections, the same as 
in Guacamole 
Protocol: RDP
Friendly Name: <ProjectID> Remote Connection via local port
```

### Windows

[Remote Desktop Connection](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/how-to-use-remote-desktop-5fe128d5-8fb1-7a23-3b8a-41e636865e8c) relevant from step 2 "_Use Remote Desktop to connect to the PC you set up_" onwards. The Remote Desktop Connection program is preinstalled on Windows machines.

1. Open the 'Remote Desktop Connection' program (`mstsc` in Run)
2. Input `localhost:<port forwarded to>` e.g. `localhost:23001` as the connection name![Windows Remote Desktop](../images/access/rdp_client_connect/Windows_Remote_Desktop.png)
3. Click 'Connect'
4. Input VDI login credentials once prompted at the login screen

### macOS

These instructions use the [Microsoft Windows App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-app/). This is a free program available from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/windows-app/id1295203466?mt=12).

1. Open the Windows App -> Click '+' -> Add PC
2. Input into 'PC Name' the forwarded port on the local machine `localhost:<port forwarded to>` e.g. `localhost:23001`![macOS server input](../images/access/rdp_client_connect/macos_ip_input.png)
3. Also add a 'friendly name' to describe the device being connected to
4. Leave all other options as defaults at this stage
5. Click Add
6. Double-click on the newly created PC to connect
7. You will be prompted for the VDI username and password

### Linux

The following uses [Remmina](https://remmina.org), a stable Linux RDP client available via most package managers.

1. Install and open Remmina
2. Select "Add a new connection profile" in the top right for the connection profile window to appear![linux add new connection](../images/access/rdp_client_connect/Add_New_Connection_Remmina.png)
3. Ensure that 'Protocol' is set to RDP
4. In the 'Server' field input the localhost and forwarded port `localhost:<port forwarded to>` e.g. `localhost:23001`![Linux configuration via Remmina](../images/access/rdp_client_connect/Connection_Config_Remmina.png)
5. Enter a 'Friendly Name' to describe the device being connected to
6. Leave the 'Username' and 'Password' fields blank at this stage (recommended). After your first successful connection, save your VDI credentials here for easier connection in the future
7. Click Save and Connect: you will be able to simply click on the friendly name next time you want to connect to the machine
