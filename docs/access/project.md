# EIDF Portal

Projects for the EIDF Virtual Desktop service are accessed via the
[EIDF Portal](https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/approval/).

!!! info
    Currently the EIDF Portal can only be accessed from University of Edinburgh IP addresses
    so the appropriate VPN will need to be used if accessing outside of campus.

To log in you will be redirected to the [SAFE log on page](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk).
If you do not have a SAFE account follow the instructions in the
[SAFE documentation](https://epcced.github.io/safe-docs/safe-for-users/)
how to register and receive your password.

## How to request to join a project

Login to the [EIDF Portal](https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/approval/) and
navigate to "Projects" and choose "Request access".
Select the project that you want to join in the "Project" dropdown list -
you can search for the project name or the project code, e.g. "eidf0123".

Now you have to wait for your PI or project manager to accept your request to register.

## How to apply for a project as a Principal Investigator

### Create a new project application

Navigate to the [EIDF Portal](https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/approval/).
To log in you will be redirected to the [SAFE log on page](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk).

If you do not have a SAFE account follow the instructions in the
[SAFE documentation](https://epcced.github.io/safe-docs/safe-for-users/)
how to register and receive your password.

Once you have logged in click on "Applications" in the menu and choose "New Application".

1. Fill in the Application Title - this will be the name of the project once it is approved.
1. Choose a start date and an end date for your project.
1. Click "Create" to create your project application.

Once the application has been created you see an overview of the form you are
required to fill in. You can revisit the application at any time by clicking on
"Applications" and choosing "Your applications" to display all your current and past
applications and their status, or follow the link
[https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/approval/proposal/](https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/approval/proposal/).

### Populate a project application

Fill in each section of the application as required:

* Previous Use of Data Analytics or HPC Resources
* EIDF Desktop Software Requirements
* EIDF Data Management Plan
* Case for Support

You can edit and save each section separately and revisit the application at a later time.

#### Datasets

You are required to fill in a "Dataset" form for each dataset that you are planning to store and process as part of your project.

We are required to ensure that projects involving "sensitive" data have the necessary permissions in place.
The answers to these questions will enable us to decide what additional documentation we may need, and whether your project may need to be set up in an independently governed Safe Haven.
There may be some projects we are simply unable to host for data protection reasons.

#### Resource Requirements

Add an estimate for each size and type of VM that is required.

### Submission

When you are happy with your application, click "Submit".
If there are missing fields that are required these are highlighted and your submission will fail.

When your submission was successful the application status is marked as "Submitted" and
now you have to wait while the EIDF approval team considers your application.
You may be contacted if there are any questions regarding your application or further
information is required,
and you will be notified of the outcome of your application.

### Approved Project

If your application was approved, follow the
[EIDF Virtual Desktops Quickstart](../../services/virtualmachines/quickstart/)
on how to view your project and the
[EIDF Virtual Desktops Documentation](../../services/virtualmachines/docs/)
on how to manage a project and create virtual machines and accounts.
