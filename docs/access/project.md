# EIDF Portal

Projects using the Virtual Desktop cloud service are accessed via the
[EIDF Portal](https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/).

The EIDF Portal uses EPCC's SAFE service management software to manage
user accounts across all EPCC services. To log in to the Portal you
will first be redirected to the [SAFE log on
page](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk).  If you do not have a SAFE account
follow the instructions in the [SAFE
documentation](https://epcced.github.io/safe-docs/safe-for-users/) how
to register and receive your password.

## How to request to join a project

Log in to the [EIDF Portal](https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/) and
navigate to "Projects" and choose "Request access".
Select the project that you want to join in the "Project" dropdown list -
you can search for the project name or the project code, e.g. "eidf0123".

Now you have to wait for your PI or project manager to accept your request to join.

Once your request is accepted, the project manager creates an account for you
and enables access to the machines that you require in your project.
You cannot request accounts, this has to be done by your project manager.
If you cannot see any accounts in the project after joining please get in touch with
the PI or a project manager and ask them to create one for you.

## How to apply to use EIDF Services

We welcome applications from Principal Investigtors who hold academic reserach grants and commercial customers.

To apply for a project on EIDF, you must have funding secured or a means to pay

### I don't have funding yet, how can I find out how much it costs to use?

Our web pages have detailed costs and prices
Please visit the [our web pages](https://edinburgh-international-data-facility.ed.ac.uk/access) for the current costs.

Please note, costs are correct at the time of publication, but will change.

To get a detailed, full cost to include in a any grant application or for an estimate, you can
begin a new project application which gives you access to pricing calculator.

### Create a new project application

*To use EIDF, you must have funding or a means to pay.*

Navigate to the [EIDF Portal](https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/) and log
in via SAFE if necessary (see above).

Once you have logged in click on "Applications" in the menu and choose "New Application".

1. Fill in the Application Title - this will be the name of the project once it is approved.
1. Choose a start date and an end date for your project.
1. Select the services for which you are applying.
1. Click "Create" to create your project application.

Once the application has been created you see an overview of the form you are
required to fill in. You can revisit the application at any time by clicking on
"Applications" and choosing "Your applications" to display all your current and past
applications and their status, or follow the link
[https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/proposal/](https://portal.eidf.ac.uk/proposal/).

### Populate a project application

Fill in each section of the application as required:

#### Case for Support

Please include here how you intend to pay for services on EIDF
You *must* include reference to either a

* UKRI Grant number

OR a

* Purchase Order to the University of Edinburgh

Please contact the EIDF Helpdesk if you require a Purchase Order.

If you do not have either, but need to use the pricing calculator for a grant costing or estimate for a Purchase Order, please continue.

#### EIDF Services Required

You can edit and save each section separately and revisit the application at a later time.

#### Pricing

Please use the pricing calcultor to itemise what services you require.

The calculator will price your projected usage.

You can then use this costing in any grant application, or in a Purchase Order.

If you have funding secured, please proceed with your application

#### Editors

You may invite other editors to your application.
Editors must have a valid SAFE login and they will receive an email with your invitation and a link.

#### Datasets

You are required to fill in a "Dataset" form for each dataset that you are planning to store and process as part of your project.

We are required to ensure that projects involving "sensitive" data have the necessary permissions in place.
The answers to these questions will enable us to decide what additional documentation we may need, and whether your project may need to be set up in an independently governed Safe Haven.

There may be some projects we are simply unable to host for data protection reasons.

#### Virtual Desktop Requirements

Add an estimate for each size and type of VM that is required.

### Submission

When you are happy with your application, and you have funds, please click "Submit".

If there are missing fields that are required these are highlighted and your submission will fail.

When your submission was successful the application status is marked as "Submitted" and
now you have to wait while the EIDF team considers your application.

You may be contacted if there are any questions regarding your application or further
information is required.

### Re-visting an Application with Secured Funding

If you have yet to secure funding and are creating an application for a cost estimate at this stage, you do not need to "Sumbit".

Your application is automatically saved

Once you have your grant confirmed or your Purchase Order in place, you can add details of funding to your application, then "Submit"

#### Note on Pricing

Our pricing calculator includes an inflation escalator for costs.

Cost for access to EIDF will increase, and as such any application for use in the future should budget for cost increases.
