The EIDF VDI is a web portal that displays the connections to VMs a user has available to them, and then those connections can be easily initiated by clicking on them in the user interface. Once connected to the target VM, all interactions are mediated through the user's web browser by the EIDF VDI. Login to the EIDF VDI Once your membership request to join the appropriate EIDF project has been approved, you will be able to login to the EIDF VDI at https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/vdi . Authentication to the VDI is provided by SAFE, so if you do not have an active web browser session in SAFE, you will be redirected to the SAFE log on page . If you do not have a SAFE account follow the instructions in the SAFE documentation how to register and receive your password. Navigating the EIDF VDI After you have been authenticated through SAFE and logged into the EIDF VDI, if you have multiple connections available to you that have been associated with your user (typically in the case of research projects), you will be presented with the VDI home screen as shown below VDI home page with list of available VM connections Connecting to a VM If you have only one connection associated with your VDI user account (typically in the case of workshops), you will be automatically connected to the target VM's virtual desktop.

For instance, the screenshot below shows a resulting connection to a Xubuntu 20.04 VM with the Xfce desktop environment. VM virtual desktop VDI Features for the Virtual Desktop The EIDF VDI is an instance of the Apache Guacamole clientless remote desktop gateway. Since the connection to your VM virtual desktop is entirely managed through Guacamole in the web browser, there are some additional features to be aware of that may assist you when using the VDI. The VDI Menu The Guacamole menu is a sidebar which is hidden until explicitly shown. On a desktop or other device which has a hardware keyboard, you can show this menu by pressing <Ctrl> + <Alt> + <Shift> on a Windows PC client, or <Ctrl> + <Command> + <Shift> on a Mac client. To hide the menu, you press the same key combination once again. The menu provides various options, including: Reading from (and writing to) the clipboard of the remote desktop Uploading and downloading files Zooming in and out of the remote display Clipboard Copy and Paste Functionality After you have activated the Guacamole menu using the key combination above, at the top of the menu is a text area labeled \u201cclipboard\u201d along with some basic instructions: Text copied/cut within Guacamole will appear here. Changes to the text below will affect the remote clipboard. The text area functions as an interface between the remote clipboard and the local clipboard. Text from the local clipboard can be pasted into the text area, causing that text to be sent to the clipboard of the remote desktop. Similarly, if you copy or cut text within the remote desktop, you will see that text within the text area, and can manually copy it into the local clipboard if desired. You can use the standard keyboard shortcuts to copy text from your client PC or Mac to the Guacamole menu clipboard, then again copy that text from the Guacamole menu clipboard into an application or CLI terminal on the VM's remote desktop. An example of using the copy and paste clipboard is shown in the screenshot below. The EIDF VDI Clipboard Keyboard Language and Layout Settings For users who do not have standard English (UK) keyboard layouts, key presses can have unexpected translations as they are transmitted to your VM. Please contact the EIDF helpdesk at eidf@epcc.ed.ac.uk if you are experiencing difficulties with your keyboard mapping, and we will help to resolve this by changing some settings in the Guacamole VDI connection configuration.

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, and helps emphasise the best practices with publishing and sharing data (more details: FAIR Principles ) What is metadata? Metadata is data about data, to help describe the dataset. Common metadata fields are things like the title of the dataset, who produced it, where it was generated (if relevant), when it was generated, and some key words describing it What is CKAN? CKAN is a metadata catalogue - i.e. it is a database for metadata rather than data. This will help with all aspects of FAIR: it will be a signposting portal for where the data actually resides it will ensure that at least metadata (even if not the data) is in a format which is easily retrievable via an identifier the metadata (and hopefully data) use terms from vocabularies that are widely recognised in the relevant field the metadata has lots of attributes to help others use it, and there are clear licence conditions where necessary What metadata will we need to provide? the title of the dataset; if a short title is not particularly descriptive, then please add a longer, separate, description too. the name of the person who created the dataset if it has spatial relevance, the latitude and longitude of the location where the dataset was generated, if possible (e.g. if a sensor has collected data, then it should be straightforward to know the lat and long) the temporal period that the dataset covers it is important to standardise the licencing for all data and we will use Creative Commons 4.0 by default. If you want a different licence, please come and talk to us. If the dataset is from a third party, you must tell us the licence of that dataset As well as the theme you've picked for your WP directory, you can add other themes in the metadata file. For example, you might have decided your WP theme is geophysics, but a dataset is also related to geodesy.

Using a standard vocabulary (such as the FAST Vocabulary) has many benefits: the terms are managed by an external body the hierarchy has been agreed (e.g. you will see for that for geophysics, it has \"skos broader\" topics of \"physics\" and \"earth sciences\", which I hope you agree with! Don't worry what \"skos\" means) using controlled vocabularies means that everybody who uses it knows they are using the same definitions as everybody else using it the vocabulary is updated at given intervals All of these advantages mean that we, as a project, don't need to think about this - there is no need to reinvent the wheel when other institutes (e.g. National Libraries) have created.

What about licensing? (What does CC-BY-SA 4.0 mean?) The R in FAIR stands for reusable - more specifically it includes this subphrase: \"(Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license\". This means that we have to tell anyone else who uses the data what they're allowed to do with it - and, under the FAIR philosophy, more freedom is better.

Home direcories are network mounted from the EIDF e1000 Lustre filesystem, although some local NVMe storage is available for temporary file storage during runs.

To create a new VM: Select the project from the list of your projects, e.g. eidfxxx Click on the 'New Machine' button Complete the 'Create Machine' form as follows: Provide an appropriate name, e.g. dev-01 . The project code will be prepended automatically to your VM name, in this case your VM would be named eidfxxx-dev-01 . Select a suitable operating system Select a machine specification that is suitable Choose the required disk size (in GB) or leave blank for the default Click on 'Create' You should see the new VM listed under the 'Machines' table on the project page and the status as 'Creating' Wait for a few minutes while the job to launch the VM completes. You have to reload the page to see updates. Once the job has completed the status shows as 'Success' in the list of machines. In the list of 'Machines' in the project page in the portal, click on the name of new VM and check it has the correct configuration, including a 10.24.*.* IP address and a default SSH Guacamole connection. Quota and Usage Each project has a quota for the number of instances, total number of vCPUs, total RAM and storage. You will not be able to create a VM if it exceeds the quota. You can view and refresh the project usage compared to the quota near the bottom of the project page. Note that the quota is not refreshed automatically when VMs are created or removed, you have to do this explicitly by pressing the \"Refresh\" button at the top of the table. Please contact the helpdesk if your quota requirements have changed. Register machine with SAFE To manage the user accounts in your project and allow users to access a VM, you have to register it as a \"SAFE machine\". Open the details page for the VM by clicking on its name in the 'Machines' table Click 'Register SAFE machine' to enable central account management Add a user account User accounts allow project members to log in to the VMs in a project. The Project PI and project managers manage user accounts for each member of the project. Users usually use one account (username and password) to log in to all the VMs in the same project that they can access, however a user may have multiple accounts in a project, for example for different roles. From the project page in the portal click on the 'Create account' button under the 'Project Accounts' table at the bottom Complete the 'Create User Account' form as follows: Choose 'Account user name': this could be something sensible like the first and last names concatenated (or initials) together with the project name. The username is unique across all EPCC systems so the user will not be able to reuse this name in another project once it has been assigned. Select the project member from the 'Account owner' drop-down field Click 'Create' The new account is allocated a temporary password which the account owner can view in their account details. Adding Access to the VM for a User User accounts can be granted or denied access to existing VMs that are registered as SAFE machines. Click on an existing user account in the 'Project Accounts' table on the project page Click 'Manage' Select the checkboxes next to the VMs that this account should have access to or uncheck the ones without access Click the 'Update' button After a few minutes, the job to give them access to the selected VMs will complete If a user only has one connection available and logs on to the VDI at https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/vdi , they will be automatically directed to the VM with the default SSH connection. First login A new user account is allocated a temporary password which the user must reset before they can log in for the first time. The password reset will not work when logging in via RDP - they must use a SSH connection, either in the VDI or via an SSH gateway. The user can view the temporary password in their account details page. Adding RDP Access to the VM To configure the VM for access via RDP: Open the VM details page by selecting the name on the project page Click on 'Configure RDP' The configuration job runs for a few minutes. Once the RDP job is completed, all users that are allowed to access the VM will also be permitted to use the RDP connection.","title":"Managing VMs"},{"location":"services/virtualmachines/docs/#service-documentation","text":"","title":"Service Documentation"},{"location":"services/virtualmachines/docs/#project-management-guide","text":"","title":"Project Management Guide"},{"location":"services/virtualmachines/docs/#create-a-vm","text":"VMs can only be created by a project manager (PM) or by the principal investigator (PI) of the project.
