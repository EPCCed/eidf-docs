The user can connect to their VM through the jump host using their given accounts. The gateway cannot be 'landed' on, a user can only pass through it. So the destination has to be known for the service to work. The gateway is currently only accessible from University of Edinburgh IP Addresses, so the appropriate VPN will need to be used if accessing outside of campus. Accessing from Windows Windows will require the installation of OpenSSH-Server or MobaXTerm to use SSH. Putty can also be used but won\u2019t be covered in this tutorial.

What is the Edinburgh International Data Facility? The Edinburgh International Data Facility (EIDF) supports learners, researchers and innovators across the spectrum, with services from basic data download, through simple learn-as-you-play-with-data notebooks, to GPU-enabled machine-learning platforms for driving AI application development. Most users of the EIDF work in the Data Service Cloud, which offers a rich set of data science and analytics tools: from browser-based notebooks to full desktop environments. The Data Service Cloud sits on top of an Analytics-Ready Data Layer (ARD Layer), where EIDF data can be shared and re-used for science and innovation. This ARD Layer will grow over time as more and more data are collected in the EIDF. Innovators and researchers looking for data can search and browse through the Data Catalogue to discover just what analytics-ready data EIDF has, and how they can get access. EIDF data managers work with data depositors at the Data Ingest Gateway, ensuring that incoming data are safely stored in the Data Lake Archive Layer, and well-described in the Data Catalogue. Data in the Data Lake are stored for the long term using best practices in digital preservation. EIDF data wranglers work in the Data Preparation Layer, often in collaboration with data depositors and others, to turn archived data from the Data Lake into analytics-ready data products in the ARD Layer. They are then ready for data innovators to create new, exciting datasets that can be stored and shared all over again. Safe Haven Services EIDF provides Safe Haven services to health and government users, following best practice in independent governance and supporting the linkage of complex personal data for public benefit research and policy making under national and regional safeguards. Safe Haven services can also be created for organisations wishing to host and govern access to their data assets in a highly secure environment. Safe Havens are isolated from the rest of EIDF, with user approvals, data ingress and egress, and permitted software all controlled by information governance bodies independent of the infrastructure itself. EIDF and the Data-Driven Innovation Initiative Launched at the end of 2018, the Data-Driven Innovation (DDI) initiative is one of six funded within the Edinburgh & South-East Scotland City Region Deal. The DDI initiative aims to make Edinburgh the \u201cData Capital of Europe\u201d, with ambitious targets to support, enhance and improve talent, research, commercial adoption and entrepreneurship across the region through better use of data. The initiative targets ten industry sectors, with interactions managed through five DDI Hubs: the Bayes Centre, the Usher Institute, Edinburgh Futures Institute, the National Robotarium, and Easter Bush. The activities of these Hubs are underpinned by EIDF.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"overview/#a-unique-service-for-academia-and-industry","text":"Built and operated by EPCC at the University of Edinburgh, EIDF is a place to store, find and work with data of all kinds.","title":"A Unique Service for Academia and Industry"},{"location":"overview/#what-is-the-edinburgh-international-data-facility","text":"The Edinburgh International Data Facility (EIDF) supports learners, researchers and innovators across the spectrum, with services from basic data download, through simple learn-as-you-play-with-data notebooks, to GPU-enabled machine-learning platforms for driving AI application development.

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, and helps emphasise the best practices with publishing and sharing data (more details: FAIR Principles ) What is metadata? Metadata is data about data, to help describe the dataset. Common metadata fields are things like the title of the dataset, who produced it, where it was generated (if relevant), when it was generated, and some key words describing it What is CKAN? CKAN is a metadata catalogue - i.e. it is a database for metadata rather than data. This will help with all aspects of FAIR: it will be a signposting portal for where the data actually resides it will ensure that at least metadata (even if not the data) is in a format which is easily retrievable via an identifier the metadata (and hopefully data) use terms from vocabularies that are widely recognised in the relevant field the metadata has lots of attributes to help others use it, and there are clear licence conditions where necessary What metadata will we need to provide? the title of the dataset; if a short title is not particularly descriptive, then please add a longer, separate, description too. the name of the person who created the dataset if it has spatial relevance, the latitude and longitude of the location where the dataset was generated, if possible (e.g. if a sensor has collected data, then it should be straightforward to know the lat and long) the temporal period that the dataset covers it is important to standardise the licencing for all data and we will use Creative Commons 4.0 by default. If you want a different licence, please come and talk to us. If the dataset is from a third party, you must tell us the licence of that dataset As well as the theme you've picked for your WP directory, you can add other themes in the metadata file. For example, you might have decided your WP theme is geophysics, but a dataset is also related to geodesy. Again, please check that this term is in the FAST vocabulary. if there is likely to be more than 1 way that the data could be made available (e.g. netCDF and csv) Why do I need to use a controlled vocabulary? Using a standard vocabulary (such as the FAST Vocabulary) has many benefits: the terms are managed by an external body the hierarchy has been agreed (e.g. you will see for that for geophysics, it has \"skos broader\" topics of \"physics\" and \"earth sciences\", which I hope you agree with! Don't worry what \"skos\" means) using controlled vocabularies means that everybody who uses it knows they are using the same definitions as everybody else using it the vocabulary is updated at given intervals All of these advantages mean that we, as a project, don't need to think about this - there is no need to reinvent the wheel when other institutes (e.g. National Libraries) have created. You might recognise WorldCat - it is an organisation which manages a global catalogue of ~18000 libraries world-wide, so they are in a good position to generate a comprehensive vocabulary of academic topics! What about licensing? (What does CC-BY-SA 4.0 mean?) The R in FAIR stands for reusable - more specifically it includes this subphrase: \"(Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license\". This means that we have to tell anyone else who uses the data what they're allowed to do with it - and, under the FAIR philosophy, more freedom is better. CC-BY-SA 4.0 allows anyone to remix, adapt, and build upon your work (even for commercial purposes), as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

To create a new VM: Select the project from the list of your projects, e.g. eidfxxx Click on the 'New Machine' button Complete the 'Create Machine' form as follows: Provide an appropriate name, e.g. dev-01 . The project code will be prepended automatically to your VM name, in this case your VM would be named eidfxxx-dev-01 . Select a suitable operating system Select a machine specification that is suitable Choose the required disk size (in GB) or leave blank for the default Click on 'Create' You should see the new VM listed under the 'Machines' table on the project page and the status as 'Creating' Wait for a few minutes while the job to launch the VM completes. You have to reload the page to see updates. Once the job has completed the status shows as 'Success' in the list of machines. In the list of 'Machines' in the project page in the portal, click on the name of new VM and check it has the correct configuration, including a 10.24.*.* IP address and a default SSH Guacamole connection. Quota Each project has a quota for the number of instances, total number of vCPUs, total RAM and storage. You may not be able to create a VM if it exceeds the quota. Please contact the helpdesk if your quota requirements have changed. Register machine with SAFE To manage the user accounts in your project and allow users to access a VM, you have to register it as a \"SAFE machine\". Open the details page for the VM by clicking on its name in the 'Machines' table Click 'Register SAFE machine' to enable central account management Add a user account User accounts allow project members to log in to the VMs in a project. The Project PI and project managers manage user accounts for each member of the project. Users usually use one account (username and password) to log in to all the VMs in the same project that they can access, however a user may have multiple accounts in a project, for example for different roles. From the project page in the portal click on the 'Create account' button under the 'Project Accounts' table at the bottom Complete the 'Create User Account' form as follows: Choose 'Account user name': this could be something sensible like the first and last names concatenated (or initials) together with the project name. The username is unique across all EPCC systems so the user will not be able to reuse this name in another project once it has been assigned. Select the project member from the 'Account owner' drop-down field Click 'Create' The new account is allocated a temporary password which the account owner can view in their account details. Adding Access to the VM for a User User accounts can be granted or denied access to existing VMs that are registered as SAFE machines. Click on an existing user account in the 'Project Accounts' table on the project page Click 'Manage' Select the checkboxes next to the VMs that this account should have access to or uncheck the ones without access Click the 'Update' button After a few minutes, the job to give them access to the selected VMs will complete At this point, if the user logs into https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/vdi , they will be automatically directed to the VM with the default SSH connection (unless they have other connections available in the VDI). First login A new user account is allocated a temporary password which the user must reset before they can log in for the first time. The password reset will not work when logging in via RDP - they must use a SSH connection in the VDI. The user can view the temporary password in their account details page. Adding RDP Access to the VM To configure the VM for access via RDP: Open the VM details page by selecting the name on the project page Click on 'Configure RDP' The configuration job runs for a few minutes.
