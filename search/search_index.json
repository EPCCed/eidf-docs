The EIDF VDI is a web portal that displays the connections to VMs a user has available to them, and then those connections can be easily initiated by clicking on them in the user interface. Once connected to the target VM, all interactions are mediated through the user's web browser by the EIDF VDI. Login to the EIDF VDI Once your membership request to join the appropriate EIDF project has been approved, you will be able to login to the EIDF VDI at https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/vdi . Authentication to the VDI is provided by SAFE, so if you do not have an active web browser session in SAFE, you will be redirected to the SAFE log on page . If you do not have a SAFE account follow the instructions in the SAFE documentation how to register and receive your password. Navigating the EIDF VDI After you have been authenticated through SAFE and logged into the EIDF VDI, if you have multiple connections available to you that have been associated with your user (typically in the case of research projects), you will be presented with the VDI home screen as shown below: VDI home page with list of available VM connections Adding connections Note that if a project manager has added a new connection for you it may not appear in the list of connections immediately. You must log out and log in again to refresh your connections list. Connecting to a VM If you have only one connection associated with your VDI user account (typically in the case of workshops), you will be automatically connected to the target VM's virtual desktop. Once you are connected to the VM, you will be asked for your username and password as shown below (if you are participating in a workshop, then you may not be asked for credentials) VM virtual desktop connection user account login screen Once your credentials have been accepted, you will be connected to your VM's desktop environment. For instance, the screenshot below shows a resulting connection to a Xubuntu 20.04 VM with the Xfce desktop environment. VM virtual desktop VDI Features for the Virtual Desktop The EIDF VDI is an instance of the Apache Guacamole clientless remote desktop gateway. Since the connection to your VM virtual desktop is entirely managed through Guacamole in the web browser, there are some additional features to be aware of that may assist you when using the VDI. The VDI Menu The Guacamole menu is a sidebar which is hidden until explicitly shown. On a desktop or other device which has a hardware keyboard, you can show this menu by pressing <Ctrl> + <Alt> + <Shift> on a Windows PC client, or <Ctrl> + <Command> + <Shift> on a Mac client. To hide the menu, you press the same key combination once again. The menu provides various options, including: Reading from (and writing to) the clipboard of the remote desktop Uploading and downloading files Zooming in and out of the remote display Clipboard Copy and Paste Functionality After you have activated the Guacamole menu using the key combination above, at the top of the menu is a text area labeled \u201cclipboard\u201d along with some basic instructions: Text copied/cut within Guacamole will appear here. Changes to the text below will affect the remote clipboard. The text area functions as an interface between the remote clipboard and the local clipboard. Text from the local clipboard can be pasted into the text area, causing that text to be sent to the clipboard of the remote desktop. Similarly, if you copy or cut text within the remote desktop, you will see that text within the text area, and can manually copy it into the local clipboard if desired. You can use the standard keyboard shortcuts to copy text from your client PC or Mac to the Guacamole menu clipboard, then again copy that text from the Guacamole menu clipboard into an application or CLI terminal on the VM's remote desktop. An example of using the copy and paste clipboard is shown in the screenshot below. The EIDF VDI Clipboard Keyboard Language and Layout Settings For users who do not have standard English (UK) keyboard layouts, key presses can have unexpected translations as they are transmitted to your VM. Please contact the EIDF helpdesk at eidf@epcc.ed.ac.uk if you are experiencing difficulties with your keyboard mapping, and we will help to resolve this by changing some settings in the Guacamole VDI connection configuration.

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, and helps emphasise the best practices with publishing and sharing data (more details: FAIR Principles ) What is metadata? Metadata is data about data, to help describe the dataset. Common metadata fields are things like the title of the dataset, who produced it, where it was generated (if relevant), when it was generated, and some key words describing it What is CKAN? CKAN is a metadata catalogue - i.e. it is a database for metadata rather than data. This will help with all aspects of FAIR: it will be a signposting portal for where the data actually resides it will ensure that at least metadata (even if not the data) is in a format which is easily retrievable via an identifier the metadata (and hopefully data) use terms from vocabularies that are widely recognised in the relevant field the metadata has lots of attributes to help others use it, and there are clear licence conditions where necessary What metadata will we need to provide? the title of the dataset; if a short title is not particularly descriptive, then please add a longer, separate, description too. the name of the person who created the dataset if it has spatial relevance, the latitude and longitude of the location where the dataset was generated, if possible (e.g. if a sensor has collected data, then it should be straightforward to know the lat and long) the temporal period that the dataset covers it is important to standardise the licencing for all data and we will use Creative Commons 4.0 by default. If you want a different licence, please come and talk to us. If the dataset is from a third party, you must tell us the licence of that dataset As well as the theme you've picked for your WP directory, you can add other themes in the metadata file. For example, you might have decided your WP theme is geophysics, but a dataset is also related to geodesy. Again, please check that this term is in the FAST vocabulary. if there is likely to be more than 1 way that the data could be made available (e.g. netCDF and csv) Why do I need to use a controlled vocabulary? Using a standard vocabulary (such as the FAST Vocabulary) has many benefits: the terms are managed by an external body the hierarchy has been agreed (e.g. you will see for that for geophysics, it has \"skos broader\" topics of \"physics\" and \"earth sciences\", which I hope you agree with! Don't worry what \"skos\" means) using controlled vocabularies means that everybody who uses it knows they are using the same definitions as everybody else using it the vocabulary is updated at given intervals All of these advantages mean that we, as a project, don't need to think about this - there is no need to reinvent the wheel when other institutes (e.g. National Libraries) have created. You might recognise WorldCat - it is an organisation which manages a global catalogue of ~18000 libraries world-wide, so they are in a good position to generate a comprehensive vocabulary of academic topics! What about licensing? (What does CC-BY-SA 4.0 mean?) The R in FAIR stands for reusable - more specifically it includes this subphrase: \"(Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license\". This means that we have to tell anyone else who uses the data what they're allowed to do with it - and, under the FAIR philosophy, more freedom is better. CC-BY-SA 4.0 allows anyone to remix, adapt, and build upon your work (even for commercial purposes), as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

Home direcories are network mounted from the EIDF e1000 Lustre filesystem, although some local NVMe storage is available for temporary file storage during runs.

This includes the principal investigator (PI) of the project and all project managers (PM). Through SAFE the PI can designate project managers and the PI and PMs can grant a project member the Cloud Admin role: Click \"Manage Project in SAFE\" at the bottom of the project page (opens a new tab) On the project management page in SAFE, scroll down to \"Manage Members\" Click Add project manager or Set member permissions For details please refer to the SAFE documentation: How can I designate a user as a project manager? Create a VM To create a new VM: Select the project from the list of your projects, e.g. eidfxxx Click on the 'New Machine' button Complete the 'Create Machine' form as follows: Provide an appropriate name, e.g. dev-01 . The project code will be prepended automatically to your VM name, in this case your VM would be named eidfxxx-dev-01 . Select a suitable operating system Select a machine specification that is suitable Choose the required disk size (in GB) or leave blank for the default Tick the checkbox \"Configure RDP access\" if you would like to install RDP and configure VDI connections via RDP for your VM. Select the package installations from the software catalogue drop-down list, or \"None\" if you don't require any pre-installed packages Click on 'Create' You should see the new VM listed under the 'Machines' table on the project page and the status as 'Creating' Wait while the job to launch the VM completes. This may take up to 10 minutes, depending on the configuration you requested. You have to reload the page to see updates. Once the job has completed successfully the status shows as 'Active' in the list of machines. You may wish to ensure that the machine size selected (number of CPUs and RAM) does not exceed your remaining quota before you press Create, otherwise the request will fail. In the list of 'Machines' in the project page in the portal, click on the name of new VM to see the configuration and properties, including the machine specification, its 10.24.*.* IP address and any configured VDI connections. Quota and Usage Each project has a quota for the number of instances, total number of vCPUs, total RAM and storage. You will not be able to create a VM if it exceeds the quota. You can view and refresh the project usage compared to the quota in a table near the bottom of the project page. This table will be updated automatically when VMs are created or removed, and you can refresh it manually by pressing the \"Refresh\" button at the top of the table. Please contact the helpdesk if your quota requirements have changed. Add a user account User accounts allow project members to log in to the VMs in a project. The Project PI and project managers manage user accounts for each member of the project. Users usually use one account (username and password) to log in to all the VMs in the same project that they can access, however a user may have multiple accounts in a project, for example for different roles. From the project page in the portal click on the 'Create account' button under the 'Project Accounts' table at the bottom Complete the 'Create User Account' form as follows: Choose 'Account user name': this could be something sensible like the first and last names concatenated (or initials) together with the project name. The username is unique across all EPCC systems so the user will not be able to reuse this name in another project once it has been assigned. Select the project member from the 'Account owner' drop-down field Click 'Create' The new account is allocated a temporary password which the account owner can view in their account details. Adding Access to the VM for a User User accounts can be granted or denied access to existing VMs. Click 'Manage' next to an existing user account in the 'Project Accounts' table on the project page, or click on the account name and then 'Manage' on the account details page Select the checkboxes in the column \"Access\" for the VMs to which this account should have access or uncheck the ones without access Click the 'Update' button After a few minutes, the job to give them access to the selected VMs will complete and the account status will show as \"Active\". If a user is logged in already to the VDI at https://eidf-vdi.epcc.ed.ac.uk/vdi newly added connections may not appear in their connections list immediately. They must log out and log in again to refresh the connection information, or wait until the login token expires and is refreshed automatically - this might take a while. If a user only has one connection available in the VDI they will be automatically directed to the VM with the default connection. Sudo permissions A project manager or PI may also grant sudo permissions to users on selected VMs. Management of sudo permissions must be requested in the project application - if it was not requested or the request was denied the functionality described below is not available. Click 'Manage' next to an existing user account in the 'Project Accounts' table on the project page Select the checkboxes in the column \"Sudo\" for the VMs on which this account is granted sudo permissions or uncheck to remove permissions Make sure \"Access\" is also selected for the sudo VMs to allow login Click the 'Update' button After a few minutes, the job to give the user account sudo permissions on the selected VMs will complete. On the account detail page a \"sudo\" badge will appear next to the selected VMs. Please contact the helpdesk if sudo permission management is required but is not available in your project. First login A new user account is allocated a temporary password which the user must reset before they can log in for the first time. The password reset will not work when logging in via RDP - they must use a SSH connection, either in the VDI or via an SSH gateway. The user can view the temporary password in their account details page. Updating an existing machine Adding RDP Access If you did not select RDP access when you created the VM you can add it later: Open the VM details page by selecting the name on the project page Click on 'Configure RDP' The configuration job runs for a few minutes. Once the RDP job is completed, all users that are allowed to access the VM will also be permitted to use the RDP connection. Software catalogue You can install packages from the software catalogue at a later time, even if you didn't select a package when first creating the machine.
