What is the Edinburgh International Data Facility? The Edinburgh International Data Facility (EIDF) supports learners, researchers and innovators across the spectrum, with services from basic data download, through simple learn-as-you-play-with-data notebooks, to GPU-enabled machine-learning platforms for driving AI application development. Most users of the EIDF work in the Data Service Cloud, which offers a rich set of data science and analytics tools: from browser-based notebooks to full desktop environments. The Data Service Cloud sits on top of an Analytics-Ready Data Layer (ARD Layer), where EIDF data can be shared and re-used for science and innovation. This ARD Layer will grow over time as more and more data are collected in the EIDF. Innovators and researchers looking for data can search and browse through the Data Catalogue to discover just what analytics-ready data EIDF has, and how they can get access. EIDF data managers work with data depositors at the Data Ingest Gateway, ensuring that incoming data are safely stored in the Data Lake Archive Layer, and well-described in the Data Catalogue. Data in the Data Lake are stored for the long term using best practices in digital preservation. EIDF data wranglers work in the Data Preparation Layer, often in collaboration with data depositors and others, to turn archived data from the Data Lake into analytics-ready data products in the ARD Layer. They are then ready for data innovators to create new, exciting datasets that can be stored and shared all over again. Safe Haven Services EIDF provides Safe Haven services to health and government users, following best practice in independent governance and supporting the linkage of complex personal data for public benefit research and policy making under national and regional safeguards. Safe Haven services can also be created for organisations wishing to host and govern access to their data assets in a highly secure environment. Safe Havens are isolated from the rest of EIDF, with user approvals, data ingress and egress, and permitted software all controlled by information governance bodies independent of the infrastructure itself. EIDF and the Data-Driven Innovation Initiative Launched at the end of 2018, the Data-Driven Innovation (DDI) initiative is one of six funded within the Edinburgh & South-East Scotland City Region Deal. The DDI initiative aims to make Edinburgh the \u201cData Capital of Europe\u201d, with ambitious targets to support, enhance and improve talent, research, commercial adoption and entrepreneurship across the region through better use of data. The initiative targets ten industry sectors, with interactions managed through five DDI Hubs: the Bayes Centre, the Usher Institute, Edinburgh Futures Institute, the National Robotarium, and Easter Bush. The activities of these Hubs are underpinned by EIDF.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"overview/#a-unique-service-for-academia-and-industry","text":"Built and operated by EPCC at the University of Edinburgh, EIDF is a place to store, find and work with data of all kinds.","title":"A Unique Service for Academia and Industry"},{"location":"overview/#what-is-the-edinburgh-international-data-facility","text":"The Edinburgh International Data Facility (EIDF) supports learners, researchers and innovators across the spectrum, with services from basic data download, through simple learn-as-you-play-with-data notebooks, to GPU-enabled machine-learning platforms for driving AI application development.

FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, and helps emphasise the best practices with publishing and sharing data (more details: FAIR Principles ) What is metadata? Metadata is data about data, to help describe the dataset. Common metadata fields are things like the title of the dataset, who produced it, where it was generated (if relevant), when it was generated, and some key words describing it What is CKAN? CKAN is a metadata catalogue - i.e. it is a database for metadata rather than data. This will help with all aspects of FAIR: it will be a signposting portal for where the data actually resides it will ensure that at least metadata (even if not the data) is in a format which is easily retrievable via an identifier the metadata (and hopefully data) use terms from vocabularies that are widely recognised in the relevant field the metadata has lots of attributes to help others use it, and there are clear licence conditions where necessary What metadata will we need to provide? the title of the dataset; if a short title is not particularly descriptive, then please add a longer, separate, description too. the name of the person who created the dataset if it has spatial relevance, the latitude and longitude of the location where the dataset was generated, if possible (e.g. if a sensor has collected data, then it should be straightforward to know the lat and long) the temporal period that the dataset covers it is important to standardise the licencing for all data and we will use Creative Commons 4.0 by default. If you want a different licence, please come and talk to us. If the dataset is from a third party, you must tell us the licence of that dataset As well as the theme you've picked for your WP directory, you can add other themes in the metadata file. For example, you might have decided your WP theme is geophysics, but a dataset is also related to geodesy. Again, please check that this term is in the FAST vocabulary. if there is likely to be more than 1 way that the data could be made available (e.g. netCDF and csv) Why do I need to use a controlled vocabulary? Using a standard vocabulary (such as the FAST Vocabulary) has many benefits: the terms are managed by an external body the hierarchy has been agreed (e.g. you will see for that for geophysics, it has \"skos broader\" topics of \"physics\" and \"earth sciences\", which I hope you agree with! Don't worry what \"skos\" means) using controlled vocabularies means that everybody who uses it knows they are using the same definitions as everybody else using it the vocabulary is updated at given intervals All of these advantages mean that we, as a project, don't need to think about this - there is no need to reinvent the wheel when other institutes (e.g. National Libraries) have created. You might recognise WorldCat - it is an organisation which manages a global catalogue of ~18000 libraries world-wide, so they are in a good position to generate a comprehensive vocabulary of academic topics! What about licensing? (What does CC-BY-SA 4.0 mean?) The R in FAIR stands for reusable - more specifically it includes this subphrase: \"(Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license\". This means that we have to tell anyone else who uses the data what they're allowed to do with it - and, under the FAIR philosophy, more freedom is better. CC-BY-SA 4.0 allows anyone to remix, adapt, and build upon your work (even for commercial purposes), as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. It also explicitly includes Sui Generis Database Rights, giving rights to the curation of a database even if you don't have the rights to the items in a database (e.g. a Spotify playlist, even though you don't own the rights to each track).
