This can enable running the same R program across a range of systems, as it works on Linux and Windows (and other clients). However, you can also fork the existing R process to create your new workers, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>cl &lt;-makeCluster(5, type=\"FORK\")\n</code></pre> <p>This saves you from having to create the variables or objects that were setup in the R program/script prior to the creation of the cluster, as they are automatically copied to the workers when using this forking mode. However, it is limited to Linux style systems and cannot scale beyond a single node.</p> <p>Once you have finished using a parallel cluster you should shut it down to free up computational resources, using <code>stopCluster</code>, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>stopCluster(cl)\n</code></pre> <p>When using clusters without the forking approach, you need to distribute objects and variables from the main process to the workers using the <code>clusterExport</code> function, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>library(parallel)\nvariableA &lt;- 10\nvariableB &lt;- 20\nmySum &lt;- function(x) variableA + variableB + x\ncl &lt;- makeCluster(4)\nres &lt;- try(parSapply(cl=cl, 1:40, mySum))\n</code></pre> <p>The program above will fail because <code>variableA</code> and <code>variableB</code> are not present on the cluster workers. Try the above on the SDF and see what result you get.</p> <p>To fix this issue you can modify the program using <code>clusterExport</code> to send <code>variableA</code> and <code>variableB</code> to the workers, prior to running the <code>parSapply</code> e.g.:</p> <pre><code>clusterExport(cl=cl, c('variableA', 'variableB'))\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"services/","title":"EIDF Services","text":""},{"location":"services/#computing-services","title":"Computing Services","text":"<p>Data Science Virtual Desktops</p> <p>Managed JupyterHub</p> <p>Cerebras CS-2</p> <p>Ultra2</p>"},{"location":"services/#data-management-services","title":"Data Management Services","text":"<p>Data Catalogue</p>"},{"location":"services/cs2/","title":"Cerebras CS-2","text":"<p>Get Access</p> <p>Running codes</p>"},{"location":"services/cs2/access/","title":"Cerebras CS-2","text":""},{"location":"services/cs2/access/#getting-access","title":"Getting Access","text":"<p>Access to the Cerebras CS-2 system is currently by arrangement with EPCC.
